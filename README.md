# SQL_Projects
SQL projects focused on secure blackmail/extortion reporting systems, evidence management, and database security best practices, including SQL injection simulation and prevention.

# SQL Blackmail Reporting System

This project is a set of SQL scripts to manage blackmail reports and evidence. It lets you:

- Store reports with details like who reported, what happened, and when
- Track if thereâ€™s evidence attached to the report
- Automatically update report status when evidence is added
- Keep some reports anonymous if needed

There are also some example queries to show how to get open reports or reports with evidence.

The whole thing is for learning how to build secure databases and practice SQL skills like triggers and constraints.

## How to Use

1. Run the SQL scripts in your SQL Server environment.
2. Use the example queries to see how the data works.
3. Modify or add reports and evidence as needed.
